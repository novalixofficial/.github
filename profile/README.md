# NovAliX Services's of Scientific Software Development Github

Here lies **all of the known code** produced by **any** NoAliX Entity. 

If there is software produced, it should exists here, otherwise the "Services of Scientific Software Development" dose'nt have knowledge of it.

## Tips 

|What|Where|
|---|---|
|Main code used in all fullstack projects | [Novalix Fullstack Boilerplate](https://github.com/novalixofficial/BoilerplateCICD)|
| All Automation and CI/CD | [Novalix Actions](https://github.com/novalixofficial/actions)|
| Helpful Code Snippets ( JS, Python, docker, etc...) | [Novalix CodeUtils](https://github.com/novalixofficial/CodeUtils)|

## When creating a new project 

If the [Novalix Fullstack Boilerplate](https://github.com/novalixofficial/BoilerplateCICD) fits (and it often does), start by forking the boilerplate to base your project off of it. 

This will make sure that your project have : 
- README
- Project Inputs/Outputs doc
- Conception diagrams and notes (.excalidraw.png or .drawio.png)
- List of testsheets sent to users ( but not their results)
- Example UI and mockups
